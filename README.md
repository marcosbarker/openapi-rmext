# OpenAPI RMEXT

## About
This script aims to perform the conversion of *Swagger 1.x* or *2.x* to *OpenAPI 3.0* and remove the *OpenAPI Extensions* generated by API Platform, getting a clean documentation.

## Usage
```sh
node create_openapi <file>
```
```sh
npm start <file>
```

A `.json` file will be generated using the API name and version contained in the base document.
